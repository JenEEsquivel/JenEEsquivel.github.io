<h2>Jennifer's Short Bio</h2>
<div class="bio">
    <p>Jennifer was born and raised in Wisconsin.  She has lived around Wisconsin, in Knoxville, Tennessee, and in Central and South America.
    </p>  

    <p>In Costa Rica, she completed her undergrad studies on a full scholarship for an intensive study-abroad program in tropical ecology.  She planned her undergraduate work so that she could finish her final undergrad semester abroad and return to start graduate school in Conservation Geography (people/nature studies, community-based conservation and Latin America.)  Between her undergraduate and grad studies, she worked in Monteverde as a cloud forest ecotourist guide.
    </p>  

    <p>Jennifer has worked teaching (Extinction of Species) at UW-Madison, worked for the DNR (in Endangered Resources and for parks). She has managed several internet websites and the portal databases of Forests.org (http://forests.org).  Jennifer has helped form several non-profits, worked on websites and served on the board of directors for: Rainforest Biodiversity Group (http://rbg.org) and Friends of the Wisconsin Wolf (fofww.org.)  In volunteering to maintain websites for the non-profits she co-founded, she became more interested in web development.  This interest lead her to the YWeb Academy to learn more.  In addition to working in front-end web development and web technology, she intends on creating another non-profit and website(in her free time) to connect people around the world with crowd-funding for their self-designed conservation projects.
