About Me
I was born and raised in southern Wisconsin and have lived in other exciting places, including Tennessee and Central America. While living in Costa Rica, I completed my undergrad undergraduate degree at UW-Madison (BS) on a full scholarship for an intensive study-abroad program in tropical ecology. I returned to start graduate school at UW-Madison in Conservation Geography after living in Costa Rica and working in Monteverde as a cloud forest ecotourist guide. During graduate school, I taught the course "Extinction of Species" and at UW-Madison worked for the DNR in Endangered Resources. I enjoy volunteering and have donated website and database administration services for several non-profit organizations. I helped found, and served on the board of directors for Rainforest Biodiversity Group (RBG)I currently volunteer as the website administrator and social media liason for RBG. Additionally, I currently volunteer and am on the board of directors (VP) for Friends of the Wisconsin Wolf (FOFWW). In volunteering to maintain websites and databases for these and other non-profit organizations, I became more interested in web development. This interest lead me to the YWeb Career Academy to participate in the web development bootcamp (Summer 2015) to learn more. In addition to working in front-end web development and web technology, I intend to create a new non-profit and website (in my free time) that connects people around the world with funding for their self-designed conservation projects. I live with my teenage daughter, two rescue cats and Alfredo--our goldfish mascot. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, reading, learning new things, traveling, surfing (both on the internet and in the Pacific Ocean), snorkeling, hiking and camping.
