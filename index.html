      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>Southern Wisconsin is where I made my first appearance in the world.  Other places I have called home include Tennessee and several places in Costa Rica.  While living in Monteverde, Costa Rica, I completed my bachelor of science degree from UW-Madison in an intensive study-abroad program in Spanish and tropical ecology (on a full scholarship).  Following that program, I worked as ecotourist guide in the cloud forest.  I loved spending my time in the forest.  That was certainly one of my favorite jobs.  Even though it only paid room and board, it actually seemed like being on a free vacation.  Following my time exploring rainforests and cloud forests, I returned to start graduate school at UW-Madison in Conservation Geography. During graduate school, I taught the wildlife ecology course "Extinction of Species" and and worked for the DNR in the Department of Endangered Resources.  After defending my Master's thesis (Ecological Restoration in a Tropical Context) and graduating with my MS degree, I managed an ecological restoration and consulting company in Mount Horeb, WI (until it was sold).  Since then, I have been a full-time single mom, consultant and volunteer for several organizations.</p>

      <p>I enjoy volunteering and have donated website and database administration services for several non-profit organizations.  Additonally, I co-founded and served on the board of directors for <a href="http://rainforestbiodiversity.org" target=”_blank”>Rainforest Biodiversity Group (RBG).</a> Currently I am assisting RBG with our website and facebook pages<a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Rainforest-Biodiversity-Group-Inc/" target=”_blank”>RBG Facebook</a> Additionally, I currently volunteer and am on the board of directors for  <a href="http://http://fofww.org" target=”_blank”> Friends of the Wisconsin Wolf (FOFWW).</a> In volunteering to maintain websites and databases for these and other non-profit organizations, I became more interested in web development.  This interest lead me to the YWeb Career Academy to participate in the web development bootcamp (Summer 2015) to learn more.  In addition to working in front-end web development and web technology, I intend to create a new non-profit and website (in my free time) that connects people around the world with funding for their self-designed conservation projects.
      </p>

      <p>I live with my teenage daughter, two rescue cats and Alfredo--our goldfish mascot.  In my free time, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, reading, writing, traveling, hiking, camping and surfing--the internet and the ocean.</p>
